# Lofful's WoW WOTLK Addons
![If you are looking for WoW Classic (Click here)](https://github.com/ZaxLofful/Lofful-s-WoW-Classic-Addons)

I dual-box as Rogue/Priest (compltely manualy not software asisted in anyway). It can become a hassle to update the addons on both of my computers. So I created this repo initally for that, but some friends wanted my addons as well.

This is an autoupdated list of the addons I use in game. Lots of good stuff...

**List of Addons and Mini-Tutorial for Each:**

**Auctioner** - Basically An Auto-Auction Addon

When you open the auction house it adds extra tabs that are very usefull and will auto-calc prices and stacks for you. Super easy to make money this way. You can scan the whole AH, whic the "play" button. It will save prices for everything so you can review it when out in the field.

**ZPERL** - UI Addon that makes everything moveable and themeable. I use this to arange my addons party portraits (including my own) into a better view.

I personally like to have my chracter portrait right next to my character in the middle of the screen. That way I can see my health and my enemies health as a side by side comparison without looking away.

**FasterLooter** - This mod automatically loots everything from a body and doesn't even show you the loot screen. (I persoanlly don't like seeing the loot screen unless I have to)

You can either disable this mod all together if you like to see the loot window, or you can do Shift+Right-click for it to not auto-loot and show you the loot window.

**WIM** - WoW Instant Messenger - This addon acts like a normal IM client, but its for your whispers. It also will automtically disappear when you are in combat to save screen space.

It makes a pop-up window that allows you to manage your conversations with people via tabs and not having to scroll back through the chat window. It makes whipsers a lot easier to manage and review.

**Usage:**

/zperl in the chat window: This allows you to move everything around and will bring up an extra customziation window to change things even more.

You can turn each of the ZPERL modules on/off independantly through the "All" tab (this is within the extras window)

When using the new Auctioner, just allow it to do a full auto-scan and then cum.

**Release Notes:**

I took out Guide Ally Routes, because it was messing up during QA Unit testing.
